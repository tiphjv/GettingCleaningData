=====================

This file describes the walkthrough for the project course of Coursera's course Getting and cleaning data'.

- Download and unzip the data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
- Put the R script 'run_analysis.R' in the unzipped folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset' and go into that folder.
- Run the 'run_analysis.R' script which will merge the training set and test set, add descriptive variables names, extract only the features concerning the means and standard deviations, add descriptive activity names and finally, it provides a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject in the 'tidy.txt' file.
